# Parcel Clipper

### Functions

This script was made to make my job more efficient. It allows me to quickly process utility requests in the city I work for by only typing in the ID rather than searching the database for them and clipping it using the GUI. This has improved my workflow drastically allowing me to focus on my data analysis projects and webgis projects with survey123, leaflet, and various other API projects I am working on.

There is basic data validation to keep the program from crashing. I'm sure there are other bugs to fix but this would be a waste of time currently.
